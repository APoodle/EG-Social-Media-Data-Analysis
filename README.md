### Overview

The objective of this analysis was to figure out the trends of Evil Geniuses' social media performance throughout the first quarter of the year. I have mainly used Python to get all of the insights and to create all of the visualizations used in this project.
I do plan in the future to make a PowerBI dashboard to show all of the insights neatly and effectively.

The insights and the visualizations are shown in the PDF file
