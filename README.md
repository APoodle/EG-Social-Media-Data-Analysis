# <div align="center">An Analysis of Evil Genuises' Social Media Performance </div>
### Overview

The objective of this analysis was to figure out the trends of Evil Geniuses' social media performance throughout the first quarter of the year. I have mainly used Python to get all of the insights and to create all of the visualizations used in this project.
I do plan in the future to make a PowerBI dashboard to show all of the insights neatly and effectively.

The insights and the visualizations are presented in both the Jupyter Notebook (ipynb file) and the PDF.

### Prerequisites
To fully understand the process and the concepts used for this project, I would recommend to have a good understanding of:
- Python and Jupyter Notebook
- The Python Libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

### Architecture
This is the architecture of the project, it is very simple and can be seen through the diagram below

The project's architecture follows just two steps:
- Data Cleaning: The raw data is processed and cleaned
- Data Transformation: The clean data is then transformed into new variables for valuable insights
- Data Visualization: The clean and transformed data is used for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
